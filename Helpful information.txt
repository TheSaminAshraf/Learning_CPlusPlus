VS Code
To create a new file, choose View > Explorer from the top nav to open the Explorer pane, and
then click the New File icon to the right of the project name. Alternately,
choose File > New File from the top nav. Then give your new file a name
(don’t forget the .cpp extension). If the file appears inside the .vscode folder,
drag it up one level to the project folder.
Next open the tasks.json file, and find the line "${file}",.
You have two options here:
If you wish to be explicit about what files get compiled, replace "${file}", with the name of
each file you wish to compile, one per line, like this:
"main.cpp",
"add.cpp",
Reader “geo” reports that you can have VS Code automatically compile all .cpp files in the
directory by replacing "${file}", with "${fileDirname}\\**.cpp" (on Windows).
Reader “Orb” reports that "${fileDirname}/**.cpp" works on Unix.
